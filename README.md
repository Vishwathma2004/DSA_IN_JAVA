# 🚀 Java & DSA Mastery Repository

Welcome to the **Java & Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Mastery Repository**! 🎯 This repository is a curated collection of concepts, implementations, and problem-solving approaches in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and DSA using Java**. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find something valuable here! 🔥

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 🔷 OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming in Java)
Master the four pillars of OOP: **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**.

📌 **Key Topics:**
- **Abstraction/** - Implementing abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation/** - Data hiding and access modifiers.
- **Inheritance/** - Understanding parent-child relationships.
- **Polymorphism/** - Method overloading and overriding.
- **Singleton/** - Implementing the Singleton design pattern.
- **Wrapper.java** - Exploring wrapper classes in Java.
- **Garbage.java** - Memory management and garbage collection.
- **Generics/** - Type safety and reusability.
- **ExceptionHandling/** - Handling runtime errors effectively.
- **Access/** - Understanding access specifiers.
- **Contructor.java & Contructor.class** - Understanding constructors and their usage.
