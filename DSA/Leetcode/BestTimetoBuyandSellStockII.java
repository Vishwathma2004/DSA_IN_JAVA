// 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

// You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

// Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
// Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
// Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
